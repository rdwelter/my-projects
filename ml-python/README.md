<h3>About these projects:</h3>

<p>I've had a fascination with machine learning/AI concepts since I was aware of Deepmind's Go and Chess bots. Since I am working on a degree in Computer Engineering, a lot of the classes I would've taken in CS about AI aren't within my degree requirements, and therefore are hard to get into for anyone outside of CS. I still want to build projects with these concepts, so this repo is a place where I can write code and store ideas whenever I have a break with my schoolwork.</p>
