<h3>About this project</h3>

<p>My girlfriend and I love board games, and Connect 4 is one of those games we always find ourselves coming back to. Unfortunately for her, I am way better than her at Connect 4, and I need a way to humble myself after winning dozens of games in a row. I figured this would be one way to both convince myself that I am not a world champion Connect 4 player, and to learn better strategies to beat my girlfriend in this board game.</p>
